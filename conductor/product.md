# Product Definition

## Initial Concept
Zero-Gap is an application designed to help individuals overcome burnout and prepare for job searching during career gaps. It achieves this by enabling users to track their actions, analyze their emotions, and engage in small, manageable challenges. The backend API server, which this project represents, supports the core functionality of this application.

## Core Features
### Action Challenges
- AI-recommended challenge titles based on selectable durations (short, medium, long), with user-defined descriptions for personalization.
- Examples: coding problems, resume editing, reading, exercise, short study sessions.

### Emotional Journaling
- Track daily emotional scores and brief entries.
- Visualize emotional trends through calendars and graphs.

### Engagement Triggers
- A system to re-engage users who haven't used the app for 3 days.
- Prompt: "Starting again is enough with just one line."

### Achievement Tracking & Visualization
- Dashboard displaying completed challenges, streak days, average emotional scores, and daily success.

## Project Goal
To provide a robust backend API server for the Zero-Gap mobile application, ensuring efficient data management for user actions, emotional states, challenges, and achievements.
