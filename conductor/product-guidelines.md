# Product Guidelines

## Tone and Voice
The Zero-Gap application should communicate with its users in an **Empathetic & Supportive** tone. This means focusing on understanding user struggles, offering encouragement, and fostering a sense of positive progress. While this project is a backend API server, all communication related to API design, error messages, and documentation should indirectly support this overarching user-facing tone.

## Backend Communication Principles
- **Clarity in API Responses:** Ensure API responses are clear, concise, and provide meaningful feedback to the frontend application, especially concerning success, failure, or validation issues.
- **Supportive Error Messaging:** Design error messages that are helpful and guide the frontend in assisting the user, rather than being purely technical and uninformative.
- **Consistent Terminology:** Use consistent terminology for data models and API endpoints to reflect the user-centric language of the application.
