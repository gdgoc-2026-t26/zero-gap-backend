# Tech Stack

## Overview
This project's backend API server is built using a modern and scalable technology stack designed for robustness and performance.

## Core Technologies

### Backend Framework
- **Spring Boot (Java)**: A powerful, opinionated framework for building production-ready Spring applications quickly. It simplifies the development of microservices and REST APIs, leveraging the Java ecosystem.

### Database
- **MySQL**: A widely used open-source relational database management system. It's known for its reliability, performance, and robust feature set, making it suitable for managing application data.
- **Flyway**: Used for reliable database schema migrations, ensuring consistent database states across environments.

### Security
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Implemented using JJWT for stateless, secure authentication and authorization across API endpoints.

### Deployment & Infrastructure
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: A suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products. GCP provides a scalable and secure environment for deploying and managing the backend API server.
- **Jib**: Utilized for building optimized Docker containers for deployment to GCP without requiring a local Docker daemon.

### Artificial Intelligence Integration
- **Gemini 3 API**: Integration with the Gemini 3 API to leverage advanced AI capabilities, likely for features such as AI-recommended challenges or emotional analysis as described in the product definition.
