# Tech Stack

## Overview
This project's backend API server is built using a modern and scalable technology stack designed for robustness and performance.

## Core Technologies

### Backend Framework
- **Spring Boot (Java)**: A powerful, opinionated framework for building production-ready Spring applications quickly. It simplifies the development of microservices and REST APIs, leveraging the Java ecosystem.

### Database
- **MySQL**: A widely used open-source relational database management system. It's known for its reliability, performance, and robust feature set, making it suitable for managing application data.

### Deployment & Infrastructure
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: A suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products. GCP provides a scalable and secure environment for deploying and managing the backend API server.

### Artificial Intelligence Integration
- **Gemini 3 API**: Integration with the Gemini 3 API to leverage advanced AI capabilities, likely for features such as AI-recommended challenges or emotional analysis as described in the product definition.
